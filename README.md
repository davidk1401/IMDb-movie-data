# IMDb Movie Data
Exploratory analysis and scripts to clean, transform and visualize large amounts of data from the Internet Movie Database. Most cleaning was performed using Jupyter Notebooks (Python/Pandas), with a bit of final fine tuning done in Google Sheets. Visualizations were then created using Tableau.
